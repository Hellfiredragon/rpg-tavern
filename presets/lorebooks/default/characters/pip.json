  "name": "Pip the Bard",
  "content": "A wiry halfling bard who frequents The Rusty Flagon, trading songs for supper. Last night he was dozing by the hearth when he saw a shadowy figure slip behind the bar toward the storeroom. He didn't get a good look, but he noticed muddy boots and heard the creak of the trapdoor. When asked, he says: \"I saw someone head for the storeroom late last night. Heard the trapdoor creak. Whoever it was, they went down to the cellar.\"",
